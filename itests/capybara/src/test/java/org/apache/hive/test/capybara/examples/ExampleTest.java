  // TODO
  // * Make it work with HS2
  // * Make it work with security
  // * Make it work with HBase metastore
  // * Make work for multi-user
  // * Should scale move to M on the cluster instead of K?
  // * Add qfile translator.
  // * Add default scale (-1) to DataGenerator.generateData so people can set pctNull without
  // messing with the scale.
  // * Make is so the user can change the package for tests created by UserQueryGenerator
  // * Split up the infra package into interface and impl, it's getting too big and confusing.
  // Move DataGenerator from top to interface.
  // * Make older version of Hive work as benchmark

  // TODO - needs tested
  // * Test ability to generate data in parallel (on cluster) for large data
  // * Test ability to compare data in tables, for ETL type queries

  // FIXME
  // * Make decimal work with default precision and scale
  // * Make binary work with Derby
  // * We don't properly drop old records in the testtables when we discover a wrong version of
  // the table.
  // * We don't do anything to assure that joined user tables generate records that will join.
  // This is somewhat hard in that Hive statistics don't help us, but we may want to at least
  // detect the join conditions and do something to make sure we don't get null results.  In
  // particular we could infer pk/fk relationships in star schemas.
